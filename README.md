# Fossil Archive 🦖

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/specimenry)

A personal, high-performance web application designed for fossil collectors, sedimentologists, and paleontology enthusiasts to log, manage, and showcase their fossil specimens.

**Live:** [https://specimenry.online/](https://specimenry.online/) (GitHub Pages)

The Fossil Archive is a fully offline-capable, local-first database built on standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS). All your sensitive data and images are securely stored entirely on your device using `IndexedDB`.

## Features ✨

- **Local-First Privacy**: No servers, no accounts, and no data tracking. Everything lives directly in your browser. See [docs/STORAGE.md](docs/STORAGE.md) for what is stored in IndexedDB vs localStorage vs optional sync.
- **Modular codebase**: Core helpers live in `js/lib/` (DB, mineral care, provenance, filters, dictation status, errors) for safer changes on GitHub Pages without a bundler.
- **Field Simple mode**: Name, photo, location, notes, and save — optimized for logging specimens outdoors.
- **Offline dictation**: On-device Whisper (first download ~75 MB); badge shows when **ready offline**.
- **Persisted filters**: Last search/filter state is restored per device.
- **Bulk edit**: Mass-change country, formation, status, and tags for large collections.
- **Drawer labels + QR**: From Storage Explorer, print a drawer label with contents list and a QR that filters back to that drawer.
- **Field diary**: Trip logs (date, locality, GPS, photos) with specimen linking — Utilities → Field Diary.
- **Shareable catalog**: Export a privacy-safe HTML catalog (no prices/storage/private docs) for collectors or museums.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: A fully responsive interface featuring a Floating Action Button (FAB) stack for critical controls, ensuring seamless use across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Scientific Etymology Tooltips**: Integrated paleontological dictionary that automatically annotates specimen names. Hover over roots like *saurus*, *pteryx*, or *idae* to see their scientific meanings and origins.
- **Interactive Geological Timeline**: Each specimen features a high-fidelity timeline bar, visualizing its position in Earth's 541-million-year history (Phanerozoic Eon) relative to the Present.
- **Stratigraphic Column Visualizer**: A vertical timeline representing the Phanerozoic Eon on your dashboard. It highlights collected geological periods, reveals gaps in your collection, and features educational tooltips, gamifying the collecting experience.
- **Detailed Taxonomic & Geological Data**: Built-in support for intricate geological periods, epochs, stages (custom stratigraphic ages), and estimated age in millions of years (Ma).
- **Data Insights Dashboard**: Comprehensive, dynamic charts and statistics summarizing your collection's taxonomic diversity, geographical distribution, and estimated valuation.
- **"Sea Monsters" Theme**: Immersive visual styling with period-specific color tints and gradients for Ordovician, Devonian, and Cretaceous specimens, evoking classic paleontology documentaries.
- **Collection vs. Wishlist**: Seamlessly manage both the fossils you currently own and the ones you are actively hunting for. Rank your wishlist intuitively using built-in **drag-and-drop** functionality.
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Quickly search through notes and localities, or filter by taxonomy and geological age. Sort by purchase price, age, or recently added.
- **Intelligent Image Handling**:
  - Upload multiple photos per specimen (including seamless, client-side HEIC conversion for iPhone photos).
  - Background image compression shrinks heavy raw photos into highly optimized thumbnails, guaranteeing a smooth and fast scrolling experience even with hundreds of cataloged items.
- **Duplication Tool**: Streamlines data entry by allowing you to quickly copy existing fossil specimens with shared properties (location, period, etc.).
- **Import / Export**: Full JSON backups to easily transfer your collection between devices, plus a CSV import tool to migrate existing spreadsheets into your vault.
- **Mass Management**: Select multiple fossils to quickly delete or process batches.

## Usage 📖

Because the application runs entirely locally, there is no complicated backend setup required.

### Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the index file: Simply double-click on `index.html` (or drag it into your browser) to launch the app.
3. Add a Fossil: Click the **+ Add Fossil** button in the top right (or the floating action button on mobile) to log your first specimen.
4. Upload Images: You can upload JPEGs, PNGs, WebP files, or even raw HEIC photos straight from an iPhone. The app automatically resizes and optimizes them behind the scenes.

*(Note: While the app is perfectly functional running purely from the `file://` protocol, you may want to serve it using a simple local HTTP server like `python -m http.server` for the most accurate behavior depending on your browser's local security policies).*

### Backing Up Data
Since data is saved locally in your browser's IndexedDB, clearing site data **may delete your collection**.

> Your data lives in this browser — export backups regularly.

* Use **Database → Backup & Restore** to download a dated `.json` file. The backup includes **specimens (with photos)** and **field diary trips**.
* To restore, open the same panel and choose **Restore from file…**.
* Optional Google Drive / P2P sync is separate; a JSON file is still the safest portable copy.

### CSV Import
If you currently track your collection in Excel or Google Sheets, you can export it as a CSV file and use the **Import CSV** command. The application will automatically attempt to map standard columns (like `specimen`, `category`, `period`, `price`, etc.) directly into the database.

### Lightweight tests

Open [`tests/index.html`](tests/index.html) in a browser (or visit `/tests/` when served). Covers formula parsing, provenance restriction matching, and JSON backup serialize/parse — **20 assertions**, no build step.
- **HTML5 & Vanilla Javascript (ES5+)** - Ensuring longevity and lack of framework bloat.
- **Vanilla CSS** - Clean, responsive UI with modern custom CSS properties.
- **IndexedDB** - High capacity local browser storage.
- **PapaParse** - Robust CSV parsing.
- **heic2any** - Client-side HEIC-to-JPEG image conversions.
